# N2VW

An universal library for converting number to Vietnamese words

## Getting started

## CLI

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
